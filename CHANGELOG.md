## [1.79] 2026-04-10 — Demo: UNDERSTAND narrow-screen fix — panels scroll instead of clipping

**Fixed**
- `StageScreen.tsx` — at ≤1100px, `understand-outer` no longer has fixed `calc(100vh - 120px)` height; switched to `height: auto` + scrollable, same as the ≤680px rule. Previously, the center panel consumed 38vh and left only ~160px for the left/right panels — the GIS TRACK right panel was clipped by `overflow: hidden` and appeared to "disappear" at medium screen widths.
- Center panel height reduced from `38vh` to `300px` at ≤1100px; left/right panels get `min-height: 260px` / `300px` respectively so all content is accessible by scrolling

## [1.77] 2026-04-10 — Demo: equal-width 3-panel layout across all scenario stages

**Changed**
- `StageScreen.tsx` (UNDERSTAND) — panels now `flex: 1` each instead of fixed 200px / flex:1 / 320px; at ≤1100px center wraps full-width, left+right share space equally
- `ProtocolPanel.tsx` (DECIDE) — steps, map, and cameras panels now `flex: 1` each instead of 36% / flex:1 / 200px; separator lines via CSS class, camera pip image uses 100% width
- `SplitLayout.tsx` (ACT) — already equalized in v1.76
- Consistent 1px `rgba(173,198,255,0.1)` separator between all panels across all three layouts

## [1.76] 2026-04-10 — Demo: floating BottomNav + 3-panel layout for all stages

**Changed**
- `ScenarioPlayer.tsx` — enabled floating `BottomNav` for all non-LEARN stages; added `paddingBottom: 80px` to main content to clear it
- `StageScreen.tsx` — UNDERSTAND stage now uses an early-return 3-panel flex layout (vehicle data | map | protocol/cameras) instead of overlapping absolute panels; map is center with `order: -1` so it appears first when wrapping; disabled internal nav (replaced by floating BottomNav)
- `ProtocolPanel.tsx` — refactored from 2 panels to 3: steps panel (36%) | map panel (flex: 1) | camera PiPs panel (200px, hidden at ≤1100px); disabled internal nav
- `SplitLayout.tsx` — refactored from nested 2-panel to flat 3-panel: phone mockup (260px) | operational map (flex: 1) | tactical units list (220px, hidden at ≤1100px); at ≤768px panels stack vertically; disabled internal nav
- `BottomNav.tsx` — cleaned up styling: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`, compact sizing on tablet/mobile, center teaser hidden at ≤480px

**Fixed**
- UNDERSTAND stage panels overlapping on narrow screens (was caused by 3 absolutely-positioned panels in a shared container)
- Navigation buttons appearing twice (both internal per-component nav and floating BottomNav)

## [1.75] 2026-04-10 — Demo: responsive nav buttons across all stage layouts

**Fixed**
- `StageScreen.tsx`, `ProtocolPanel.tsx`, `SplitLayout.tsx` — added `demo-stage-nav-btn`, `demo-stage-nav-sublabel`, `demo-stage-nav-mainlabel`, `demo-stage-nav-icon` CSS classes to all PREV/NEXT nav buttons
- At ≤768px: button padding reduced to `8px 16px`, sub-labels ("Proceed to next step" / "Go back") hidden, main label font shrinks to 0.78rem, icon box shrinks to 24×24
- At ≤480px: padding further reduced to `6px 12px`, main label font shrinks to 0.68rem
- Buttons now stay compact and proportional on tablet and mobile screens

## [1.74] 2026-04-10 — Demo: full responsive pass across all stage components

**Changed**
- `TopBar.tsx` — pills shrink + scroll on tablet (≤768px); entire row 2 hidden on mobile (≤480px); header row 1 shorter on mobile
- `BottomNav.tsx` — compact height on tablet/mobile; center teaser hidden on tablet; prev/next labels hidden on mobile; simplified to icon+short text only
- `ProtocolPanel.tsx` — camera PiPs shrink to 160px at 900px, 130px at 768px; layout stacks vertically at 768px; map panel hidden at 480px
- `StageScreen.tsx` — understand map panel shrinks to 340px at 900px, hidden at 680px; outer padding reduced
- `SplitLayout.tsx` — phone+map panels stack vertically at 768px; map hidden at 480px; padding reduced on mobile
- `LearnLayout.tsx` — three dashboard cards stack vertically at 768px with scroll
- `ScenarioPlayer.tsx` — `paddingTop` responsive: 120px → 88px (tablet) → 48px (mobile) matching header collapse

---

## [1.73] 2026-04-10 — Demo: TopBar stage pills — hover & active states

**Changed**
- `TopBar.tsx` — added CSS hover/active states for stage pills: inactive pills darken on hover and flash blue on press; active pill deepens blue on hover; `data-active` attribute wired for CSS targeting

---

## [1.72] 2026-04-10 — Demo: ACT stage phone panel — brighter radial background

**Changed**
- `SplitLayout.tsx` — left panel (smartphone mockup) now has a radial gradient background (`#1f3e62` center → `#0f1e2e` edges) instead of flat `#162235`, creating a subtle spotlight that makes the phone frame pop

---

## [1.71] 2026-04-10 — Demo: show all platform modules in title area, highlight active ones

**Changed**
- `StageScreen.tsx`, `ProtocolPanel.tsx`, `SplitLayout.tsx`, `LearnLayout.tsx` — module strip now renders all 9 platform modules every time; active modules for the current stage get a solid blue pill (`#1755c2` text, `rgba(0,122,255,0.1)` bg, blue border + bold weight); inactive modules are muted gray; each pill includes its Material icon
- `ALL_MODULES` imported from `TopBar` in all four layout components

---

## [1.70] 2026-04-10 — Demo: move module tags from header to stage title area

**Changed**
- `TopBar.tsx` — removed Row 3 (platform modules strip) from the fixed header; modules are already rendered inline with the stage title in each layout component (StageScreen, ProtocolPanel, SplitLayout, LearnLayout)
- All demo layout components — updated `calc(100vh - 168px)` → `calc(100vh - 120px)` to account for the shorter two-row header
- `ScenarioPlayer.tsx` — updated `paddingTop` from 168px to 120px

---

## [1.69] 2026-04-10 — Demo: TopBar nav blended into white content area

**Changed**
- `TopBar.tsx` — stage lifecycle pills (row 2) and module tags (row 3) now render on `#f1f4f8` light background matching the content area, eliminating the jarring dark-to-white transition; row 1 (logo/badge) retains dark brand chrome; pills/tags restyled with dark-on-light colors and blue active states; outer header border and shadow updated to suit light bottom edge

**Fixed**
- Map fill in UNDERSTAND stage: removed `top: 28` offset from map container in `StageScreen.tsx` so Leaflet tiles now cover the full panel rectangle; header bar, camera inset, and incident overlay float above via z-index

---

## [1.68] 2026-04-10 — Demo: white background treatment for LEARN stage + street routing on all maps

**Changed**
- `LearnLayout.tsx` — applied the same white `#f1f4f8` background treatment as DETECT/UNDERSTAND/DECIDE/ACT: stage title/description above a dark rounded panel (`#0f1e33`), resolved badge + module tags in the header row, light nav buttons (ghost PREV, dark navy "Choose Another Scenario") outside the panel
- `ScenarioPlayer.tsx` — extended `isLightBg` to include `learn` layout; passes `isLightBg` to `LearnLayout`
- `DispatchMap.tsx`, `DecideMapPanel.tsx`, `UnderstandMapPanel.tsx` — removed OSRM dependency; all three maps now use pre-computed Houston street waypoints passed via `route` prop instead of fetching external routing API (which was blocked in sandbox and causing straight-line fallback)
- `lpr.ts` — added pre-computed `route` waypoint arrays to `understandMap`, `decideMap.units` (12-Charlie + 08-Bravo), and `splitMapCoords` following Memorial Dr / Westheimer Rd / Montrose Blvd corridors
- `types.ts` — added `route?: [number, number][]` to `splitMapCoords`, `understandMap`, and `decideMap.units`
- `SplitLayout.tsx` — passes `route` prop to `DispatchMap`; `isLightBg` treatment for ACT stage (title above dark panel, light nav)
- `StageScreen.tsx` — passes `route` prop to `UnderstandMapPanel`
- `ProtocolPanel.tsx` — `isLightBg` treatment for DECIDE stage; camera PiP overlays on map (CAM 402 highway feed + GIS track)

- `GeoPanel.tsx` — added `zIndexOffset: 2000` so SOS card renders above camera thumbnails
- `GeoPanel.tsx` — added `sosEvent` to useEffect dependency array

## [1.58] 2026-04-08 — Feat: SOS button event card marker on Understand stage map

**Added**
- `GeoPanel.tsx` — new `sosEvent` prop renders a labeled card marker (dark red card + connector line + pulsing dot) anchored to the panic button location
- `types.ts` — added `sosEvent?: { coords, label, sublabel }` to geoPanel type
- `school.ts` — wired SOS event at Room 214 coords: "⚠ SOS BUTTON EVENT · ROOM 214 · BLDG A 2F"

## [1.57] 2026-04-08 — Fix: larger CCTV thumbnails on map + rename legend label to SOS BUTTON

## [1.48] 2026-04-08 — Fix: build failure due to NODE_ENV + analytics in root layout

**Fixed**
- Build was failing with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')` during prerendering of `/_global-error` and `/_not-found` when `NODE_ENV=development` was active in the shell. Root cause: non-standard NODE_ENV caused React hooks state issues during static generation.
- Moved `GoogleAnalytics`, `GoogleTagManager`, `GoogleTagManagerNoScript` from root `layout.tsx` to `[locale]/layout.tsx` — keeps analytics out of the error-rendering path (correct architecture).

**Added**
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` — custom 404 page replacing Next.js built-in (self-contained, dark KabatOne theme).

---

**Fixed**

**Fixed**
- `next.config.ts` — Added `rewrites()` as dev fallback for Next.js 16 + Turbopack: middleware edge rewrites don't fire in Turbopack dev; rewrite rules map `/path` → `/en/path` to let the `[locale]` App Router match routes correctly
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Moved `<html>/<body>` and font variables here (root layout, required by Next.js 16 Turbopack); was missing `<html>/<body>` tags causing runtime error

**Fixed**
- Competitor links in `Footer.tsx` (Next.js) and `hero-mockup.html` now grouped under a "Competitors" / "Competidores" label with a vertical list, instead of appearing as individual inline links

- Nav.tsx: all labels now bilingual (Solutions/Soluciones, Industries/Industrias, About/Nosotros, Contact/Contacto)
- Nav arrays moved inside component for locale access

---

## [0.46] 2026-03-18 — Add carousel header to modules section
**Added**
- Carousel header with prev/next arrow buttons, module counter (01/09), large module name, and tagline — matching the original GitHub Pages layout
- Header name and tagline metadata for all 9 modules (EN + ES)

---

## [0.45] 2026-03-18 — Align Next.js homepage with GitHub Pages version
**Added**
- `ModulesSection.tsx` — 9-tab interactive Business Intelligence section (Video, Dispatch, Events, GIS, Integrations, Responder, Citizen, AI, BI) with auto-rotation, pause on hover, ARIA support, and animated progress bar
- Module screenshots in product cards (replacing placeholder grid pattern)
- Moved `/images/` to `/public/images/` so static assets are served correctly by Next.js

**Fixed**
- Product cards now show actual module screenshots instead of empty dark placeholders
- Hero headline no longer applies gradient to "Public Safety" — matches original all-white styling
- Section order now matches original: Hero → Modules tabs → Stats → Products → Why → Industries → CTA

---

## [0.44] 2026-03-18 — Next.js: all 15 pages ported EN+ES, sitemap, robots, shared components
**Added**
- Ported 12 remaining pages: K-Traffic, K-Connect, 7 industry pages (Public Safety, Municipalities, Airport, Retail, Logistics, Ports, Stadiums), Homepage, About, Contact
- Shared components: `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, `PageHero.tsx` — used across all 15 pages
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — 30 entries (15 EN + 15 ES) with hreflang alternates
- `src/app/robots.ts` — allows all crawlers, points to sitemap
- Updated existing K-Dispatch, K-Video, K-Safety pages to use shared Footer component
- Middleware matcher updated to `/:path*` for broader compatibility; file extension skip uses `\.\w+$` regex

**Verified**
- All 30 URLs return HTTP 200
- `/sitemap.xml` returns 30 `<url>` entries
- `/robots.txt` returns correct content
- `/en/k-dispatch` returns 308 redirect
- `npm run build` → 0 TypeScript errors
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors

## [0.43] 2026-03-18 — Fix: replace next-intl middleware with Node.js-compatible locale routing
**Fixed**
- `middleware.ts` — replaced `createMiddleware` from next-intl (which imports `negotiator` CJS, crashing in Vercel V8 edge isolate) with a pure Next.js `NextResponse` implementation; handles `/en/*` redirect, ES prefix passthrough, and EN internal rewrite with zero CJS dependencies
- `src/i18n/routing.ts` — simplified to plain config object (no `defineRouting`), keeps `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` for correct Nav URL generation
- `next.config.ts` — removed `withNextIntl` plugin and `beforeFiles` rewrites (now handled by custom middleware); kept `/en/:path*` → `/:path*` redirect
- `[locale]/layout.tsx` — explicit `locale={locale}` prop on `NextIntlClientProvider` so `useLocale()` in Nav.tsx resolves correctly without server-side plugin context
- `npm run build` → 0 errors, middleware compiled as edge proxy

## [0.42] 2026-03-18 — Fix: MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED on Vercel edge runtime
**Fixed**
- `middleware.ts` — wrap `createMiddleware` in explicit function; skip `/_next`, `/api`, favicon, and static file extensions before invoking intl middleware (prevents edge runtime crash on Vercel)
- No changes to `next.config.ts` or `request.ts` — already correct
- `npm run build` → 0 errors, middleware compiled as edge proxy

## [0.41] 2026-03-18 — Fix: EN at root URL, load Barlow Condensed + Space Grotesk fonts
**Fixed / Added**
- `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` — EN pages now at `/k-dispatch`, ES at `/es/k-dispatch` (no /en/ prefix visible)
- `next.config.ts` `redirects()` — `/en/:path*` → `/:path*` (308), removes redundant default locale prefix
- `next.config.ts` `rewrites(beforeFiles)` — internally maps `/k-dispatch` → `/en/k-dispatch` so App Router `[locale]` segment correctly receives 'en'
- `[locale]/layout.tsx` — Space Grotesk + Barlow Condensed loaded via `next/font/google`, CSS variables applied to `<html>`
- `globals.css` — body uses `var(--font-space-grotesk)`, h1/h2/h3 use `var(--font-barlow-condensed)`
- 0 TypeScript errors, all 6 URLs confirmed (correct lang= and page titles)

## [0.40] 2026-03-18 — Next.js: i18n routing, K-Dispatch + K-Video + K-Safety pages EN+ES
**Added**
- `src/i18n/routing.ts` — next-intl routing config (`localePrefix: 'always'`, locales: en/es)
- `src/i18n/request.ts` — `getRequestConfig` for locale detection
- `src/i18n/navigation.ts` — locale-aware `Link`, `useRouter`, `usePathname` via `createNavigation`
- `middleware.ts` — next-intl middleware at project root
- `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` — locale layout with `NextIntlClientProvider` and `lang` attr
- `src/app/[locale]/k-dispatch/page.tsx` — K-Dispatch page (EN+ES, all sections, red accent)
- `src/app/[locale]/k-video/page.tsx` — K-Video page (EN+ES, all sections, purple accent, camera grid)
- `src/app/[locale]/k-safety/page.tsx` — K-Safety page (EN+ES, all sections, cyan accent, GIS mockup)
- `src/components/Nav.tsx` — shared nav with dropdown menus, language switcher, mobile hamburger
**Changed**
- `next.config.ts` — wrapped with `createNextIntlPlugin`, added CDN image domain
- `src/app/globals.css` — added KabatOne design tokens (CSS custom properties)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — replaced with pass-through root layout (locale layout is effective root)
**Fixed**
- i18n locale routing: switched from `as-needed` to `always` prefix to fix App Router `[locale]` segment matching

## [0.39] 2026-03-18 — Next.js scaffold: content structure, EN+ES metadata, metadata helper
**Added**
- New `nextjs` branch for clean Next.js 16.2.0 rebuild (TypeScript, Tailwind v4, App Router)
- Scaffolded Next.js into repo; existing HTML files untouched
- `src/content/en/metadata.ts` — English SEO metadata for all 15 pages
- `src/content/es/metadata.ts` — Spanish SEO metadata for all 15 pages

- `next-intl` installed for i18n routing

## [0.37] 2026-03-18 — Fix: nav bar not full-width on mobile on all 5 product pages

**Fixed**
- Mobile nav `left: 0; right: 0` were missing `!important` on all 5 product pages (k-safety, k-dispatch, k-traffic, k-video, k-connect)
- Nav bar was clipped short on the right side on mobile — now spans full viewport width

## [0.36] 2026-03-18 — Fix: hamburger menu JS missing on all 7 industry pages

**Fixed**
- Mobile nav hamburger button had no JS on any of the 7 industry pages
- Added navToggle click handler and mobile dropdown expand/collapse script to all 7 files
- Both hamburger toggle and Solutions dropdown now work correctly on mobile

## [0.35] 2026-03-18 — Fix: move responsive CSS into head style block on all 7 industry pages

**Fixed**
- Responsive media query rules were in a body `<style>` tag which some browsers ignore
- Moved all responsive CSS into the `<head>` `<style>` block for all 7 industry pages
- Each page now has authoritative breakpoint rules (768/640/480/360px) in the proper location

## [0.34] 2026-03-18 — Fix missing grid-collapse rules on industry pages

**Fixed**
- municipalities: `.benefits-grid` (3-col) and `.features-two-col` (2-col) now collapse to 1-col at 640px

**Added**
- Standardized 5-point breakpoint system (360 / 480 / 640 / 768 / 1024px) applied to every HTML file
- hero-mockup.html: headline scaling (116px→30px on small phones), section padding reduction, CTA stacking at 480px, modules title/quote reduction
- 5 product pages (k-safety, k-dispatch, k-traffic, k-video, k-connect): hero-h1 scaling, section-inner padding tightening, hero-ctas and bottom-cta-btns stacking at 480px, footer stacking at 640px
- about.html: hero-h1 scaling, section padding reduction, hero-btns stacking at 480px

**Added**
- All 5 product pages (k-traffic, k-safety, k-dispatch, k-connect, k-video) now show a compact 3-column grid layout (inputs | hub | outputs) on mobile (≤640px) instead of the unreadable scaled-down SVG. Desktop SVG is unchanged.

## [0.30] 2026-03-18 — Fix mobile tab bar scroll + swipe hint
**Fixed**
- Module tab bar (Video, Dispatch, GIS, etc.) was only showing middle tabs on mobile due to `justify-content: center` making left-side tabs unreachable. Changed to `flex-start`, added iOS momentum scroll, and added a right-edge fade gradient to signal swipeability.

## [0.29] 2026-03-18 — Fix mobile nav full-width on all pages
**Fixed**
- Mobile nav was only covering the left portion of the header on 15 pages — `position: fixed` override was missing `left: 0; right: 0`, so the nav didn't stretch to full viewport width. Fixed across all product, industry, and content pages.

## [0.28] 2026-03-17 — Fix sticky nav on all remaining pages (solutions, about, contact, industries)
**Fixed**
- Same `position: relative` nav bug found on solutions.html, about.html, contact.html, and all 7 industry pages — all updated to `position: fixed !important`

## [0.27] 2026-03-17 — Fix sticky nav on mobile + diagram horizontal scroll on all product pages
**Fixed**
- Mobile nav was `position: relative` — changed to `position: fixed` so header stays sticky on scroll on all 5 product pages
- Hub-and-spoke diagram now horizontally scrollable on mobile (`overflow-x: auto`, `min-width: 560px`) instead of shrinking to illegible size

## [0.26] 2026-03-17 — Add animated hub-and-spoke "How It Works" diagrams to all product pages
**Added**
- SVG animated hub-and-spoke flow diagram replacing plain numbered steps in "How It Works" sections
- Diagrams feature: animated glowing dots flowing from input nodes → hub → output nodes, pulsing hub ring, and rotating dashed inner circle
- Each product has unique node labels and icons: K-Safety, K-Dispatch, K-Traffic, K-Video, K-Connect

## [0.25] 2026-03-17 — Update K-Safety hero stats to platform-wide figures
**Changed**
- Replaced single-site stats (5,400 cameras, 530 panic buttons, 40 cities) with platform-wide figures: 68 Projects, 100+ Agencies, 30+ Integrations

## [0.24] 2026-03-17 — Update K-Connect section text to match Kabatone.com
**Changed**

- Video is now the default active module on page load (was GIS)

---

## [0.18] 2026-03-17 — Translate remaining Spanish labels to English

**Fixed**

---

## [0.13] 2026-03-17 — Product section HTML/CSS mock dashboards

**Improved**

- Added colored glow shadow per product color to reinforce brand identity on each card

## [0.10] 2026-03-17 — Gray text contrast improvements across all pages

**Fixed**
- All 17 HTML pages: increased `--muted` from `#7b9db8` to `#9dbdd0` and `--dim` from `#94a3b8` to `#b4c4d4` — secondary text, labels, nav links, and descriptions are now noticeably more readable (contrast ratio improved from ~6:1 to ~8–9:1)
- `changelog.html`: fixed `--muted` which was incorrectly set to `#4a5c7a` (only ~2.7:1 contrast, failing WCAG AA) — now matches the corrected site-wide value
- `hero-mockup.html`: raised `.mpr-feed-label` opacity from `rgba(255,255,255,0.4)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.65)` for better readability on small text

---

## [0.9] 2026-03-17 — Mobile nav missing on industry pages + logos overflow fix

**Fixed**
- All 7 industry pages (`industry-public-safety`, `industry-municipalities`, `industry-airport`, `industry-retail`, `industry-logistics`, `industry-ports`, `industry-stadiums`): Added missing mobile nav CSS, hamburger `<button>` HTML, and JS toggle/dropdown logic — these pages were showing the full desktop nav on mobile with no hamburger
- `hero-mockup.html`: Integration logos panel (`.int-logos-wall`) — added `overflow: hidden`, reduced horizontal padding `28px` → `20px`, changed `.int-grid` `max-width` from `440px` to `100%` to prevent right-column clipping on narrow viewports

---

## [0.8] 2026-03-17 — Mobile QA pass: layout, touch, and accessibility fixes

**Fixed**
- `hero-mockup.html`: Hamburger button tap target enlarged (`padding: 8px 4px` → `14px 11px`, span width `22px` → `24px`) to meet 44×44px minimum
- `hero-mockup.html`: Stat counters now pre-populated with real values (40/70/99/24) so they don't flash "0" if JS animation is delayed
- `hero-mockup.html`: Platform pillars grid (`.why-grid`) switches to single column below 480px (was 2-col at all mobile sizes)
- `hero-mockup.html`: Quote block padding reduced from `0 48px` to `0 20px` on screens ≤480px
- `hero-mockup.html`: CTA fine-print font size raised from `10px` to `12px`
- `hero-mockup.html`: Product demo panel height increased from `220px` to `260px` on mobile to reduce image clipping
- `hero-mockup.html`: Logo link `aria-label="KabatOne — Home"` added for screen reader accessibility
- `hero-mockup.html`: Module swipe animation fixed — removed `!important` from `transform: none` and `opacity: 1` in mobile media query; the `!important` was blocking JS inline transforms, causing panels to jump instead of slide
- `hero-mockup.html`: Footer logo — added `width: auto` to prevent potential stretching

---

## [0.7] 2026-03-17 — Nav & footer link fixes on remaining pages

**Fixed**

---

## [0.6] 2026-03-17 — Improved mobile swipe for modules carousel

**Improved**
- `hero-mockup.html`: Replaced basic touchstart/touchend swipe with a full drag-based animation system
  - Real-time panel dragging follows finger position during the swipe
  - Axis locking: distinguishes horizontal swipe from vertical scroll before committing to drag
  - Threshold-based commit (≥50 px) or snap-back if swipe is too short
  - Smooth cubic-bezier slide animation on commit and snap-back
  - Proper cleanup and state reset after each gesture
- `.mod-panel-right` height changed from fixed `260px` to `min-height: 260px; height: auto` so taller content is no longer clipped

---

## [0.5] 2026-03-17 — Changelog page created

---

## [0.3] 2026-03-17 — Mobile responsiveness

- Hamburger animates to × on open; closes on outside tap
- Mobile menu shows full nav including Solutions dropdown (flat, no hover required)
- Responsive layout CSS added to all 5 solution pages:
  - 900px: hero collapses to 1 column, hero mockup hidden, grids go 2-col
  - 640px: all grids go 1 column, padding reduced for small phones

**Fixed**
- Removed broken CSS rule `.nav-links li:not(:last-child) { display: none }` that was hiding all nav links on mobile in hero-mockup.html
- Nav hamburger touch target enlarged (14px padding, 24px width)
- Nav `position: fixed` on mobile so it stays visible while scrolling
- Product screen images fill full width at tablet breakpoint

---
