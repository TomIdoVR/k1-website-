## [0.32] 2026-03-18 — Improve K-Traffic hero mockup with city map and live panels

**Improved**

- Added color-coded traffic flow overlays (green/orange/red) on road segments
- Added animated vehicle dots traversing streets using SVG animateMotion
- Added pulsing incident markers at congested intersections
- Added camera feed panel (CAM-07 with scan lines, REC badge, speeding alert)

## [0.31] 2026-03-18 — Add mobile layout for How It Works diagrams on all product pages
**Added**
- All 5 product pages (k-traffic, k-safety, k-dispatch, k-connect, k-video) now show a compact 3-column grid layout (inputs | hub | outputs) on mobile (≤640px) instead of the unreadable scaled-down SVG. Desktop SVG is unchanged.

## [0.30] 2026-03-18 — Fix mobile tab bar scroll + swipe hint
**Fixed**
- Module tab bar (Video, Dispatch, GIS, etc.) was only showing middle tabs on mobile due to `justify-content: center` making left-side tabs unreachable. Changed to `flex-start`, added iOS momentum scroll, and added a right-edge fade gradient to signal swipeability.

## [0.29] 2026-03-18 — Fix mobile nav full-width on all pages
**Fixed**
- Mobile nav was only covering the left portion of the header on 15 pages — `position: fixed` override was missing `left: 0; right: 0`, so the nav didn't stretch to full viewport width. Fixed across all product, industry, and content pages.

## [0.28] 2026-03-17 — Fix sticky nav on all remaining pages (solutions, about, contact, industries)
**Fixed**
- Same `position: relative` nav bug found on solutions.html, about.html, contact.html, and all 7 industry pages — all updated to `position: fixed !important`

## [0.27] 2026-03-17 — Fix sticky nav on mobile + diagram horizontal scroll on all product pages
**Fixed**
- Mobile nav was `position: relative` — changed to `position: fixed` so header stays sticky on scroll on all 5 product pages
- Hub-and-spoke diagram now horizontally scrollable on mobile (`overflow-x: auto`, `min-width: 560px`) instead of shrinking to illegible size

## [0.26] 2026-03-17 — Add animated hub-and-spoke "How It Works" diagrams to all product pages
**Added**
- SVG animated hub-and-spoke flow diagram replacing plain numbered steps in "How It Works" sections
- Diagrams feature: animated glowing dots flowing from input nodes → hub → output nodes, pulsing hub ring, and rotating dashed inner circle
- Each product has unique node labels and icons: K-Safety, K-Dispatch, K-Traffic, K-Video, K-Connect

## [0.25] 2026-03-17 — Update K-Safety hero stats to platform-wide figures

## [0.19] 2026-03-17 — Reorder modules carousel on home page

**Changed**

- `hero-mockup.html` K-Connect: translated network diagram labels (Schools, Police, Emergency, Business, City Hall, CONNECTED, SHARED, ENCRYPTED) and KPI panel header to "CITIZEN PORTAL ANALYTICS" for clarity

- Added colored glow shadow per product color to reinforce brand identity on each card

## [0.10] 2026-03-17 — Gray text contrast improvements across all pages

**Fixed**
- All 17 HTML pages: increased `--muted` from `#7b9db8` to `#9dbdd0` and `--dim` from `#94a3b8` to `#b4c4d4` — secondary text, labels, nav links, and descriptions are now noticeably more readable (contrast ratio improved from ~6:1 to ~8–9:1)
- `changelog.html`: fixed `--muted` which was incorrectly set to `#4a5c7a` (only ~2.7:1 contrast, failing WCAG AA) — now matches the corrected site-wide value
- `hero-mockup.html`: raised `.mpr-feed-label` opacity from `rgba(255,255,255,0.4)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.65)` for better readability on small text

---

## [0.9] 2026-03-17 — Mobile nav missing on industry pages + logos overflow fix

**Fixed**
- All 7 industry pages (`industry-public-safety`, `industry-municipalities`, `industry-airport`, `industry-retail`, `industry-logistics`, `industry-ports`, `industry-stadiums`): Added missing mobile nav CSS, hamburger `<button>` HTML, and JS toggle/dropdown logic — these pages were showing the full desktop nav on mobile with no hamburger
- `hero-mockup.html`: Integration logos panel (`.int-logos-wall`) — added `overflow: hidden`, reduced horizontal padding `28px` → `20px`, changed `.int-grid` `max-width` from `440px` to `100%` to prevent right-column clipping on narrow viewports

---

## [0.8] 2026-03-17 — Mobile QA pass: layout, touch, and accessibility fixes

**Fixed**
- `hero-mockup.html`: Hamburger button tap target enlarged (`padding: 8px 4px` → `14px 11px`, span width `22px` → `24px`) to meet 44×44px minimum
- `hero-mockup.html`: Stat counters now pre-populated with real values (40/70/99/24) so they don't flash "0" if JS animation is delayed
- `hero-mockup.html`: Platform pillars grid (`.why-grid`) switches to single column below 480px (was 2-col at all mobile sizes)
- `hero-mockup.html`: Quote block padding reduced from `0 48px` to `0 20px` on screens ≤480px
- `hero-mockup.html`: CTA fine-print font size raised from `10px` to `12px`
- `hero-mockup.html`: Product demo panel height increased from `220px` to `260px` on mobile to reduce image clipping
- `hero-mockup.html`: Logo link `aria-label="KabatOne — Home"` added for screen reader accessibility
- `hero-mockup.html`: Module swipe animation fixed — removed `!important` from `transform: none` and `opacity: 1` in mobile media query; the `!important` was blocking JS inline transforms, causing panels to jump instead of slide
- `hero-mockup.html`: Footer logo — added `width: auto` to prevent potential stretching

---

## [0.7] 2026-03-17 — Nav & footer link fixes on remaining pages

**Fixed**
- `contact.html`: Industries nav item expanded from plain link to full dropdown (all 7 industry pages); About link fixed to `about.html`; "Book a Demo" button moved inside `<ul>` (was incorrectly outside)
- `about.html`: Contact link in nav and footer fixed to `contact.html` (was `#`)
- All 7 industry pages (`industry-public-safety`, `industry-municipalities`, `industry-airport`, `industry-retail`, `industry-logistics`, `industry-ports`, `industry-stadiums`): Footer Contact link fixed to `contact.html` (was `#`)

---

## [0.6] 2026-03-17 — Improved mobile swipe for modules carousel

**Improved**
- `hero-mockup.html`: Replaced basic touchstart/touchend swipe with a full drag-based animation system
  - Real-time panel dragging follows finger position during the swipe
  - Axis locking: distinguishes horizontal swipe from vertical scroll before committing to drag
  - Threshold-based commit (≥50 px) or snap-back if swipe is too short
  - Smooth cubic-bezier slide animation on commit and snap-back
  - Proper cleanup and state reset after each gesture
- `.mod-panel-right` height changed from fixed `260px` to `min-height: 260px; height: auto` so taller content is no longer clipped

---

- Footer "Contact" link on homepage now points to `contact.html` (was `#`)

- `about.html`, all industry pages, all solution pages: minor nav + link corrections

---

**Fixed**
- Removed broken CSS rule `.nav-links li:not(:last-child) { display: none }` that was hiding all nav links on mobile in hero-mockup.html
- Nav hamburger touch target enlarged (14px padding, 24px width)
- Nav `position: fixed` on mobile so it stays visible while scrolling
- Product screen images fill full width at tablet breakpoint
