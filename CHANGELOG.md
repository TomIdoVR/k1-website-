- Hamburger animates to × on open; closes on outside tap
- Mobile menu shows full nav including Solutions dropdown (flat, no hover required)
- Responsive layout CSS added to all 5 solution pages:
  - 900px: hero collapses to 1 column, hero mockup hidden, grids go 2-col
  - 640px: all grids go 1 column, padding reduced for small phones

**Fixed**
- Removed broken CSS rule `.nav-links li:not(:last-child) { display: none }` that was hiding all nav links on mobile in hero-mockup.html
- Nav hamburger touch target enlarged (14px padding, 24px width)
- Nav `position: fixed` on mobile so it stays visible while scrolling
- Product screen images fill full width at tablet breakpoint
