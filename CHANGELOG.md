Format: `## [version] YYYY-MM-DD — Short title`

---

## [0.45] 2026-03-18 — Align Next.js homepage with GitHub Pages version
**Added**
- `ModulesSection.tsx` — 9-tab interactive Business Intelligence section (Video, Dispatch, Events, GIS, Integrations, Responder, Citizen, AI, BI) with auto-rotation, pause on hover, ARIA support, and animated progress bar
- Module screenshots in product cards (replacing placeholder grid pattern)
- Moved `/images/` to `/public/images/` so static assets are served correctly by Next.js

**Fixed**
- Product cards now show actual module screenshots instead of empty dark placeholders
- Hero headline no longer applies gradient to "Public Safety" — matches original all-white styling
- Section order now matches original: Hero → Modules tabs → Stats → Products → Why → Industries → CTA

---

## [0.44] 2026-03-18 — Next.js: all 15 pages ported EN+ES, sitemap, robots, shared components
**Added**
- Ported 12 remaining pages: K-Traffic, K-Connect, 7 industry pages (Public Safety, Municipalities, Airport, Retail, Logistics, Ports, Stadiums), Homepage, About, Contact
- Shared components: `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, `PageHero.tsx` — used across all 15 pages
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — 30 entries (15 EN + 15 ES) with hreflang alternates
- `src/app/robots.ts` — allows all crawlers, points to sitemap
- Updated existing K-Dispatch, K-Video, K-Safety pages to use shared Footer component
- Middleware matcher updated to `/:path*` for broader compatibility; file extension skip uses `\.\w+$` regex

**Verified**
- All 30 URLs return HTTP 200
- `/sitemap.xml` returns 30 `<url>` entries
- `/robots.txt` returns correct content
- `/en/k-dispatch` returns 308 redirect
- `npm run build` → 0 TypeScript errors
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors

## [0.43] 2026-03-18 — Fix: replace next-intl middleware with Node.js-compatible locale routing
**Fixed**
- `middleware.ts` — replaced `createMiddleware` from next-intl (which imports `negotiator` CJS, crashing in Vercel V8 edge isolate) with a pure Next.js `NextResponse` implementation; handles `/en/*` redirect, ES prefix passthrough, and EN internal rewrite with zero CJS dependencies
- `src/i18n/routing.ts` — simplified to plain config object (no `defineRouting`), keeps `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` for correct Nav URL generation
- `next.config.ts` — removed `withNextIntl` plugin and `beforeFiles` rewrites (now handled by custom middleware); kept `/en/:path*` → `/:path*` redirect
- `[locale]/layout.tsx` — explicit `locale={locale}` prop on `NextIntlClientProvider` so `useLocale()` in Nav.tsx resolves correctly without server-side plugin context
- `npm run build` → 0 errors, middleware compiled as edge proxy

## [0.42] 2026-03-18 — Fix: MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED on Vercel edge runtime
**Fixed**
- `middleware.ts` — wrap `createMiddleware` in explicit function; skip `/_next`, `/api`, favicon, and static file extensions before invoking intl middleware (prevents edge runtime crash on Vercel)
- No changes to `next.config.ts` or `request.ts` — already correct
- `npm run build` → 0 errors, middleware compiled as edge proxy

## [0.41] 2026-03-18 — Fix: EN at root URL, load Barlow Condensed + Space Grotesk fonts
**Fixed / Added**
- `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` — EN pages now at `/k-dispatch`, ES at `/es/k-dispatch` (no /en/ prefix visible)
- `next.config.ts` `redirects()` — `/en/:path*` → `/:path*` (308), removes redundant default locale prefix
- `next.config.ts` `rewrites(beforeFiles)` — internally maps `/k-dispatch` → `/en/k-dispatch` so App Router `[locale]` segment correctly receives 'en'
- `[locale]/layout.tsx` — Space Grotesk + Barlow Condensed loaded via `next/font/google`, CSS variables applied to `<html>`
- `globals.css` — body uses `var(--font-space-grotesk)`, h1/h2/h3 use `var(--font-barlow-condensed)`
- 0 TypeScript errors, all 6 URLs confirmed (correct lang= and page titles)

## [0.40] 2026-03-18 — Next.js: i18n routing, K-Dispatch + K-Video + K-Safety pages EN+ES
**Added**
- `src/i18n/routing.ts` — next-intl routing config (`localePrefix: 'always'`, locales: en/es)
- `src/i18n/request.ts` — `getRequestConfig` for locale detection
- `src/i18n/navigation.ts` — locale-aware `Link`, `useRouter`, `usePathname` via `createNavigation`
- `middleware.ts` — next-intl middleware at project root
- `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` — locale layout with `NextIntlClientProvider` and `lang` attr
- `src/app/[locale]/k-dispatch/page.tsx` — K-Dispatch page (EN+ES, all sections, red accent)
- `src/app/[locale]/k-video/page.tsx` — K-Video page (EN+ES, all sections, purple accent, camera grid)
- `src/app/[locale]/k-safety/page.tsx` — K-Safety page (EN+ES, all sections, cyan accent, GIS mockup)
- `src/components/Nav.tsx` — shared nav with dropdown menus, language switcher, mobile hamburger
**Changed**
- `next.config.ts` — wrapped with `createNextIntlPlugin`, added CDN image domain
- `src/app/globals.css` — added KabatOne design tokens (CSS custom properties)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — replaced with pass-through root layout (locale layout is effective root)
**Fixed**
- i18n locale routing: switched from `as-needed` to `always` prefix to fix App Router `[locale]` segment matching

## [0.39] 2026-03-18 — Next.js scaffold: content structure, EN+ES metadata, metadata helper
**Added**
- New `nextjs` branch for clean Next.js 16.2.0 rebuild (TypeScript, Tailwind v4, App Router)
- Scaffolded Next.js into repo; existing HTML files untouched
- `src/content/en/metadata.ts` — English SEO metadata for all 15 pages
- `src/content/es/metadata.ts` — Spanish SEO metadata for all 15 pages

## [0.36] 2026-03-18 — Fix: hamburger menu JS missing on all 7 industry pages

**Fixed**
- Mobile nav hamburger button had no JS on any of the 7 industry pages
- Added navToggle click handler and mobile dropdown expand/collapse script to all 7 files
- Both hamburger toggle and Solutions dropdown now work correctly on mobile

## [0.35] 2026-03-18 — Fix: move responsive CSS into head style block on all 7 industry pages

**Fixed**
- Responsive media query rules were in a body `<style>` tag which some browsers ignore
- Moved all responsive CSS into the `<head>` `<style>` block for all 7 industry pages
- Each page now has authoritative breakpoint rules (768/640/480/360px) in the proper location

## [0.34] 2026-03-18 — Fix missing grid-collapse rules on industry pages

**Added**
- All 5 product pages (k-traffic, k-safety, k-dispatch, k-connect, k-video) now show a compact 3-column grid layout (inputs | hub | outputs) on mobile (≤640px) instead of the unreadable scaled-down SVG. Desktop SVG is unchanged.

## [0.30] 2026-03-18 — Fix mobile tab bar scroll + swipe hint
**Fixed**
- Module tab bar (Video, Dispatch, GIS, etc.) was only showing middle tabs on mobile due to `justify-content: center` making left-side tabs unreachable. Changed to `flex-start`, added iOS momentum scroll, and added a right-edge fade gradient to signal swipeability.

## [0.29] 2026-03-18 — Fix mobile nav full-width on all pages
**Fixed**
- Mobile nav was only covering the left portion of the header on 15 pages — `position: fixed` override was missing `left: 0; right: 0`, so the nav didn't stretch to full viewport width. Fixed across all product, industry, and content pages.

## [0.28] 2026-03-17 — Fix sticky nav on all remaining pages (solutions, about, contact, industries)
**Fixed**
- Same `position: relative` nav bug found on solutions.html, about.html, contact.html, and all 7 industry pages — all updated to `position: fixed !important`

## [0.27] 2026-03-17 — Fix sticky nav on mobile + diagram horizontal scroll on all product pages
**Fixed**
- Mobile nav was `position: relative` — changed to `position: fixed` so header stays sticky on scroll on all 5 product pages
- Hub-and-spoke diagram now horizontally scrollable on mobile (`overflow-x: auto`, `min-width: 560px`) instead of shrinking to illegible size

## [0.26] 2026-03-17 — Add animated hub-and-spoke "How It Works" diagrams to all product pages
**Added**
- SVG animated hub-and-spoke flow diagram replacing plain numbered steps in "How It Works" sections
- Diagrams feature: animated glowing dots flowing from input nodes → hub → output nodes, pulsing hub ring, and rotating dashed inner circle
- Each product has unique node labels and icons: K-Safety, K-Dispatch, K-Traffic, K-Video, K-Connect

## [0.25] 2026-03-17 — Update K-Safety hero stats to platform-wide figures

- Video is now the default active module on page load (was GIS)

---

## [0.18] 2026-03-17 — Translate remaining Spanish labels to English

**Fixed**

---

## [0.13] 2026-03-17 — Product section HTML/CSS mock dashboards

**Improved**

- Added colored glow shadow per product color to reinforce brand identity on each card

## [0.10] 2026-03-17 — Gray text contrast improvements across all pages

**Fixed**
- All 17 HTML pages: increased `--muted` from `#7b9db8` to `#9dbdd0` and `--dim` from `#94a3b8` to `#b4c4d4` — secondary text, labels, nav links, and descriptions are now noticeably more readable (contrast ratio improved from ~6:1 to ~8–9:1)
- `changelog.html`: fixed `--muted` which was incorrectly set to `#4a5c7a` (only ~2.7:1 contrast, failing WCAG AA) — now matches the corrected site-wide value
- `hero-mockup.html`: raised `.mpr-feed-label` opacity from `rgba(255,255,255,0.4)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.65)` for better readability on small text

---

## [0.9] 2026-03-17 — Mobile nav missing on industry pages + logos overflow fix

**Fixed**
- All 7 industry pages (`industry-public-safety`, `industry-municipalities`, `industry-airport`, `industry-retail`, `industry-logistics`, `industry-ports`, `industry-stadiums`): Added missing mobile nav CSS, hamburger `<button>` HTML, and JS toggle/dropdown logic — these pages were showing the full desktop nav on mobile with no hamburger
- `hero-mockup.html`: Integration logos panel (`.int-logos-wall`) — added `overflow: hidden`, reduced horizontal padding `28px` → `20px`, changed `.int-grid` `max-width` from `440px` to `100%` to prevent right-column clipping on narrow viewports

---

## [0.8] 2026-03-17 — Mobile QA pass: layout, touch, and accessibility fixes

**Fixed**
- `hero-mockup.html`: Hamburger button tap target enlarged (`padding: 8px 4px` → `14px 11px`, span width `22px` → `24px`) to meet 44×44px minimum
- `hero-mockup.html`: Stat counters now pre-populated with real values (40/70/99/24) so they don't flash "0" if JS animation is delayed
- `hero-mockup.html`: Platform pillars grid (`.why-grid`) switches to single column below 480px (was 2-col at all mobile sizes)
- `hero-mockup.html`: Quote block padding reduced from `0 48px` to `0 20px` on screens ≤480px
- `hero-mockup.html`: CTA fine-print font size raised from `10px` to `12px`
- `hero-mockup.html`: Product demo panel height increased from `220px` to `260px` on mobile to reduce image clipping
- `hero-mockup.html`: Logo link `aria-label="KabatOne — Home"` added for screen reader accessibility
- `hero-mockup.html`: Module swipe animation fixed — removed `!important` from `transform: none` and `opacity: 1` in mobile media query; the `!important` was blocking JS inline transforms, causing panels to jump instead of slide
- `hero-mockup.html`: Footer logo — added `width: auto` to prevent potential stretching

---

## [0.7] 2026-03-17 — Nav & footer link fixes on remaining pages

**Fixed**
- `contact.html`: Industries nav item expanded from plain link to full dropdown (all 7 industry pages); About link fixed to `about.html`; "Book a Demo" button moved inside `<ul>` (was incorrectly outside)
- `about.html`: Contact link in nav and footer fixed to `contact.html` (was `#`)
- All 7 industry pages (`industry-public-safety`, `industry-municipalities`, `industry-airport`, `industry-retail`, `industry-logistics`, `industry-ports`, `industry-stadiums`): Footer Contact link fixed to `contact.html` (was `#`)

---

## [0.6] 2026-03-17 — Improved mobile swipe for modules carousel

**Improved**
- `hero-mockup.html`: Replaced basic touchstart/touchend swipe with a full drag-based animation system
  - Real-time panel dragging follows finger position during the swipe
  - Axis locking: distinguishes horizontal swipe from vertical scroll before committing to drag
  - Threshold-based commit (≥50 px) or snap-back if swipe is too short
  - Smooth cubic-bezier slide animation on commit and snap-back
  - Proper cleanup and state reset after each gesture
- `.mod-panel-right` height changed from fixed `260px` to `min-height: 260px; height: auto` so taller content is no longer clipped

---

## [0.5] 2026-03-17 — Changelog page created

**Added**
- `CHANGELOG.md` — source-of-truth change log for the repo

- Footer "Contact" link on homepage now points to `contact.html` (was `#`)

- `about.html`, all industry pages, all solution pages: minor nav + link corrections

---

## [0.3] 2026-03-17 — Mobile responsiveness

**Added**

- Hamburger animates to × on open; closes on outside tap
- Mobile menu shows full nav including Solutions dropdown (flat, no hover required)
- Responsive layout CSS added to all 5 solution pages:
  - 900px: hero collapses to 1 column, hero mockup hidden, grids go 2-col
  - 640px: all grids go 1 column, padding reduced for small phones

**Fixed**
- Removed broken CSS rule `.nav-links li:not(:last-child) { display: none }` that was hiding all nav links on mobile in hero-mockup.html
- Nav hamburger touch target enlarged (14px padding, 24px width)
- Nav `position: fixed` on mobile so it stays visible while scrolling
- Product screen images fill full width at tablet breakpoint

---
